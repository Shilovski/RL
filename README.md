* part 1 in [`crossentropy_method.ipynb`](https://github.com/Shilovski/RL/blob/main/crossentropy_method.ipynb) after the __Training loop__ section
* part 2 in [`deep_crossentropy_method.ipynb`](https://github.com/Shilovski/RL/blob/main/deep_crossentropy_method.ipynb) in the relevant part &mdash; __Homework part II__

Also, the last block of code (after interrupting the LunarLander training cycle with the keyboard) in the second part saves the rendering of the landing of the lunar lander into the `LunarLander.mp4` file in the _content_ folder in Google Colab. 
The training result of agent with an average reward of `55.568` is presented below.
